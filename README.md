# Knight-s-Tour-Puzzle

This repository contains a Python script that uses Warnsdorff's rule and backtracking algorithm to solve the Knight's Tour puzzle. It starts with a chosen cell by the user and explores all tours possible starting from that cell, if a solution is found, it stops and prints the solution. It also includes an option to visualize the solution on a chessboard. The script allows you to customize the size of the chessboard and the starting position of the knight. This is a fun and challenging problem that can be used to improve problem-solving and algorithmic skills.

Sample Input/Output:

Enter your board dimensions: 5 5 \
Enter the knight's starting position: 5 5\
Do you want to try the puzzle? (y/n): n
